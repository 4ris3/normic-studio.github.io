        <h1>Privacy Policy for Water Helper+</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [April 21, 2025]</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Dawid Stachowicz] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Water Helper+ mobile application (the "App"). We are the data controller for the information processed under this policy.</p> <!-- GDPR Addition: Identify Controller -->

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

        <h3>1. Information You Provide Directly (Stored Locally)</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, you may provide certain information which is stored <strong>only locally on your device</strong> using standard operating system features (like UserDefaults). We do not transmit this data off your device. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your daily water intake goal (e.g., 2000ml).</li>
            <li>Your current water intake progress.</li>
            <li>Notification start and end times for reminders.</li>
            <li>Custom amounts for the "Quick Add" buttons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This data remains on your device and is not collected by us or shared with third parties by us.</strong> It is used solely for the core functionality of the App.</p>

        <h3>2. Information Collected Automatically (Third-Party Partners - Google AdMob)</h3>
        <p>The App uses Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service provided by Google, to display advertisements. To make this possible, Google AdMob may collect certain information automatically from your device. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Such as your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA, if you provide consent via the App Tracking Transparency framework) or other device-level IDs.</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Coarse location data (approximate location) inferred from your IP address or other signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interaction with ads shown in the App (e.g., ad views, clicks), and interaction with the App itself related to ad serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Crash data and performance data related to the functioning of the AdMob SDK within the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed by Google. For more details on the data Google collects and how they use it, please refer to their policies linked below.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information and Lawful Basis for Processing</h2> <!-- GDPR Addition: Added Lawful Basis -->

        <p>We process information for the following purposes, relying on the specified legal bases under GDPR for users in the EU/EEA:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Data Used:</em> Information you provide directly (stored locally).</li>
                    <li><em>Purpose:</em> To enable the core features of the App (tracking water, reminders, settings). This processing occurs entirely on your device.</li>
                    <li><em>Lawful Basis:</em> Not applicable as data is not collected/processed by us off-device.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To Display Third-Party Advertisements (via Google AdMob):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Data Used:</em> Identifiers, Coarse Location, Usage Data, Diagnostics (as collected by Google).</li>
                    <li><em>Purpose:</em> To display advertisements in the App, which helps support the App's development and availability. Ads may be personalized based on the collected data if consent is given, or non-personalized otherwise.</li>
                    <li><em>Lawful Basis:</em> <strong>Consent</strong> (obtained via the ATT prompt for personalized ads/tracking, or via Google's own consent mechanisms if applicable for non-personalized ads under GDPR/ePrivacy) or <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (for displaying contextual/non-personalized ads where consent is not the required basis, and for essential operational aspects like frequency capping or fraud prevention).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Analytics and Measurement (by Google AdMob):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Data Used:</em> Identifiers, Coarse Location, Usage Data, Diagnostics.</li>
                    <li><em>Purpose:</em> For Google to analyze ad performance, measure audience engagement, and improve their advertising services.</li>
                    <li><em>Lawful Basis:</em> <strong>Consent</strong> (where applicable for measurement related to personalized ads) or <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (for aggregated analytics and measurement not requiring individual consent).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li><strong>To Maintain and Improve Services (by Google AdMob):</strong>
                 <ul>
                    <li><em>Data Used:</em> Diagnostics (Crash Data, Performance Data).</li>
                    <li><em>Purpose:</em> For Google to maintain and improve the stability and performance of the AdMob SDK.</li>
                    <li><em>Lawful Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (ensuring the technical functionality and stability of the advertising service).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>

        <p>We do not share the personal data you enter into the app (water goal, intake, etc.) with any third parties.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, the App integrates Google AdMob. Data collected automatically by Google AdMob is subject to Google's privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Privacy & Terms:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- GDPR Addition: International Transfers -->
        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Information collected by Google AdMob may be transferred to and processed in countries outside of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), including the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. Google implements measures, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws. Please refer to Google's privacy documentation for more details on their data transfer mechanisms.</p>


        <h2>Advertising and Tracking Choices</h2>
        <p>The App uses Google AdMob to serve ads. If you have provided consent through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework (for iOS users) or other applicable consent mechanisms, Google may use your device's Advertising Identifier (e.g., IDFA) to serve personalized ads and for tracking purposes across different apps and websites.</p>
        <p>You can manage your preferences regarding personalized advertising and tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Through the ATT prompt when first launching the App (iOS users).</li>
            <li>Within your device's system settings (e.g., Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking or Advertising on iOS; similar settings on Android).</li>
            <li>Through Google's ad settings or other opt-out mechanisms they provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- GDPR Addition: Data Retention -->
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not retain the locally stored data you provide beyond the time it is stored on your device under your control. Data collected by Google AdMob is retained according to Google's data retention policies. Generally, personal data should only be retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

        <!-- GDPR Addition: User Rights -->
        <h2>Your Data Protection Rights (EU/EEA Users)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data that is processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request correction of any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):</strong> You have the right to request the erasure of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data based on legitimate interests, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request the transfer of the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that for data collected automatically by Google AdMob, you should primarily exercise these rights directly with Google, as they are the controller for that data processing in many respects. You can find information on how to manage your data with Google through their privacy policies linked above. For requests related specifically to data we might control (which in this case is minimal beyond facilitating AdMob integration), you can contact us using the details below.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information. The data you enter directly into the App is stored locally on your device. For data collected by Google AdMob, Google implements its own security measures.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 16 within the EU/EEA, or 13 outside the EU/EEA (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children below these ages.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the App.</p>
